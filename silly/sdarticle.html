"I just don't understand it, we tried everything! We even briefly discussed putting them in the main room until Randall (you know, <i>Kyper</i>) reminded everyone that we have a predominantly breakbeat crowd and we'd have a <i>lot</i> of angry clubbers on our hands if we put progressive up front," said a Phire representative. "You <i>know</i> we can't have that ... gotta keep the crowd happy," he added, "Hell, we even offered free water -- and we don't even give the <i>residents</i> free water!!"

Although Rave Season reporters were unable to contact either DJ directly for comment, one of their agents suggested that the "Conditional Compensation Pending Crowd Turnout" clause in the contract was likely a contributing factor in their decision. "There was this one guy, 'Hal' or 'Al' or something that kept talking about paying them once they had a solid door count," responded the agent. "They weren't too keen on that one."
